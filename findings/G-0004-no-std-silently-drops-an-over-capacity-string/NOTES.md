# G-0004 — no-std silently drops an over-capacity string

**Status:** ✅ **fixed** in sofabgen 0.15.1 (PR
[#93](https://github.com/sofa-buffers/generator/pull/93), fixes #82) · **Lang:**
rust (no-std) · **Where:** `generator/generators/rust/visitor.go`

The over-capacity fill *was* discarded silently:

```rust
(_Loc::Root, 3) => { self.m.s.clear(); let _ = self.m.s.push_str(_s); }
```

`heapless::String::push_str` is fallible (returns `Err` past capacity), and the
result was discarded. A string longer than the field's `maxlen` was **silently
dropped to empty** instead of rejected. Combined with G-0001 the caller got no
signal at all.

**Fix (shipped):** the fill now flags capacity overflow, e.g.
`... let _ = self.m.nested.str.push_str(_s); if self.m.nested.str.len() != _s.len() { self.err = true; }`,
and `err` is surfaced through the new fallible `try_decode` (G-0001) as an
`Error` (PR [#93](https://github.com/sofa-buffers/generator/pull/93), commit
`d56a1a7`). Verified in the generated no-std `message.rs`.
